## **Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning**

## Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a Naive Bayes model to classify emails as spam or not spam. Spam emails, also known as junk emails, are unsolicited messages sent in bulk, often for advertising purposes, and can contain malicious links or content. The Naive Bayes model is established, trained, and validated using a dataset of labeled emails. Model evaluation showed that the model could detect spam emails with high accuracy.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Text feature extraction using CountVectorizer
- Model training using MultinomialNB
- Model evaluation
- Predicting new emails
